# Uber-Data-Date-Manipulation
Contains a python file for exploratory analysis and manipulation of the datetime feature
Due to the large size of the dataset, proper exploratory analysis of the data was not performed largely because of the small laptop memory.\
Some exploratory analysis that could be carried out includes seeing how users order uber or lyft during different time periods(morning, afternoon, evening, night) in relation to days of the week, what effects the surge multiplier has on users, how the distance determines which cab type an individual uses, apparent temperature knowledge affects which cab a user picks, and how temperature can affect the distance travelled. \
When using a bigger laptop memory, proper analysis would be carried out and also various ML models developed to better predict cab prices.
